# Number-Grid-Practice

A simple python program for my daughter to use to develop number sense. The script prints a 10x10 grid with numbers 1-100 in it. Next, it generates a random number from 1-100 and asks the user to identify numbers a certain distance away.

Current functionality: prints grid, asks for ten more than a randomly generated number on the grid. If ten more answer is correct, asks what ten less than the number is.



## To do:
* Tkinter to build a button array.
* Gnureadline to make the display static (that is, so it doesn't move when a new line of text comes up.)
* Add a random number generator for the question, connected to a dict ({'one':1, 'two':2, etc}) and "more" or "less".
* In general: add additional questions, simplify (condense?) code.
