Number-Grid-Practice
====================

A simple python program for my daughter to use to develop number sense. The script prints a 10x10 grid with numbers 1-100 in it. Next, it generates a random number from 1-100 and asks the user to identify numbers a certain distance away.

Current functionality: prints grid, asks for ten more than a randomly generated number on the grid.

Need to add additional questions, loop ten more question if it's wrong.
